# Operating rules for this repository

Read this before doing anything else. These rules exist because breaking them
has already caused real, measurable damage in this project — each one traces to
a specific incident, noted where useful.

## Roles

**Claude** is the architect, reviewer, verifier and dispatcher. Claude does not
write or edit scanner source code, and does not run the scanner's heavy test
workloads directly.

**Qwen Code** (via `acpx qwen`) is the implementer. It writes the code and runs
the scans.

The split is deliberate: the party that verifies a result should not be the
party that produced it.

**This is not the same axis as the scanner's inference model.** Qwen Code is a
*coding agent* that edits files in this repo. The model the scanner *calls*
while scanning is a runtime parameter selected from
`tools/scanner/shared/models.json` — currently `luna` (`gpt-5.6-luna`) by
default. Changing one has no bearing on the other. See
`docs/architecture/multi-model-architecture.md` §1.

## The blind-development boundary

The scanner must never be able to learn the answers it is being scored against.

Never expose to Qwen, or place anywhere inside this repository:

- the answer key (`benchmark_ground_truth`) or any part of it
- any pairing of a challenge identifier with a file and line
- any per-challenge hit/miss analysis
- eval output that enumerates which specific vulnerabilities were found

Private material lives in `/home/user/harness-private/`, outside the repository
root and therefore outside Qwen's sandbox. See that repo's README for the limits
of that protection.

Every dispatch prompt must carry the standing constraint: *never search for,
read, or reference any answer-key or ground-truth material anywhere on this
machine.*

This has been violated before. Committed benchmark output once listed challenge
identifiers alongside found/not-found status, and a protocol doc named challenge
keys next to their source files. Both were redacted; check for recurrences when
adding results.

Third instance, found 2026-07-28: the v2 per-file lane selector never applied
`SEED_DENYLIST`, so `models/challenge.ts` — 114 of its 183 lines a literal array
of every challenge key — was assigned as a **hunt lane**, along with
`lib/antiCheat.ts` and `data/datacreator.ts`. One lane per file means the
executor reads the whole file into the prompt. The two v2 runs on 2026-07-27
(`scanner-2026-07-27-a`, `-b`) ran against such a manifest, so **their numbers
are not blind** and must not be cited as a blind baseline. Fixed in three
independent places — the selector skips them, the executor reads through
`readCorpusFile()`, and `guard.test.ts` asserts no manifest on disk assigns a
denylisted file to a hunt lane. The pattern to learn from: the guard existed and
was correct; v2 was forked from v1 before the denylist moved into `shared/` and
silently never picked it up. **When adding a v2 of a component, diff its
security-relevant imports against v1's, not just its behaviour.**

## Verification discipline

Never report a Qwen result without independently confirming it. Read the actual
output files, run the actual checks. Agent self-reports have been wrong in ways
that mattered:

- a report claimed success while 12 of 16 playbook modules did not exist
- a lane silently vanished from a manifest and was not mentioned
- a component reported a clean run while 53 files had been recorded as empty

When a claim is load-bearing, verify it yourself before it reaches the user.

### Verify the tree before a run, not the intent

A dispatch prompt under `prompts/dispatch/` records what was *asked for*. Only the
commit graph records what a run will *execute*. These came apart on 2026-07-28:
three dispatched changes — per-playbook class disambiguation, removal of the
two-class cap, and the misconfiguration/insecure-design prompt work — were all
implemented and committed before the Luna v2 run started, but on a branch that
run's tree had forked away from. The run measured a scanner missing all three,
and the cap was demonstrably binding: 114 of its 247 findings sat exactly on the
two-class ceiling.

Before launching a scan, run `git merge-base HEAD origin/main` and diff the
scanner source against `main`. Confirm each change you believe is in force by
grepping the file, not by finding its dispatch prompt on disk. A baseline
measured from the wrong tree is worse than no baseline — it gets cited later as
if the changes had been tested and had not worked.

## Reporting

Report what happened, including cost and failure. If a run died, say what was
lost. If a metric is qualified by a known defect, state the defect alongside the
number. Do not let an infrastructure failure be read later as a reasoning
result.

## Change safety

- `tools/scanner/` contains hardcoded inter-stage paths. Do not move or rename
  anything under it without updating every reference.
- Stage artifacts — v1 and v2 alike — are addressed through
  `runPath(provider, stage)` in `tools/scanner/shared/run-paths.ts`, never a
  path literal. Both tracks are provider-isolated. See
  `docs/architecture/multi-model-architecture.md` before touching either.
- No model id, endpoint or credential env var belongs in code. They live in
  `tools/scanner/shared/models.json`; adding a model is one entry there and
  nothing else. An `if (provider === '…')` outside `shared/` breaks that.
- v1 and v2 components live side by side (`stage2-hunt-lanes` and
  `stage2-hunt-lanes-perfile`). Both are load-bearing. Preserve v1 exactly when
  building a v2 alternative.
- Prefer `git mv` so history survives.
- Confirm work is committed and pushed before removing a worktree or checkout.

## After a scan run

Invoke the `archive-run` skill. The next run overwrites stage outputs in place,
so an unarchived run is unrecoverable. One run has already been lost this way
(~3 million tokens).

## Long-running work

Scans take roughly an hour and outlive an agent session. Launch them with
`setsid nohup` so they are not reaped when the session ends, and make sure the
component checkpoints incrementally so an interruption costs one lane rather
than the whole run.
